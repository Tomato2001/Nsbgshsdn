     "Wow, @%s, it's vital for you to know that you're a complete @loser.",

"@%s, your @stuрidity knows no bounds, even street cats are ashamed of you.",

"Kid, @%s, it's no wonder that you can't achieve anything in life if you can't even @tie your shoes @properly.",

"@%s, just keep going through life making one @stuрid move after another, as if you @hаve а @соlаnder @оn your head.",

"Do you even know, @%s, what awareness is? I sense that you won't even find that word in the @dictionary.",

"I don't understand how you, @%s, manage to always end up at the bottom of the social ladder. Are you the record holder for failures or something?",

"@%s, you can confidently claim the @Title of the most hopeless case in the history of humanity.",

"I have never seen a person who can skillfully manage to repeatedly faceplant into their own @stuрidity quite like you, @%s.",

"You, @%s, are like a living example of how even a flower pot can be @smarter than you.",

"It's really cute how @%s continues to engage in the same @foolish @behavior. I hope it's his only talent.",

"Considering how you can't even add two and two together, @%s, I think it would be easier to split plutonium than to explain anything to you.",

"You, @%s, seem to have invented a new level of @idiocy and now proudly represent it all by @yоurself.",

"@%s, tell me, how many times do you need to step on a rake to understand that even your own family doesn't want to see you?",

"I'm always amazed at how you, @%s, manage to keep all ten fingers on your hands and not do anything intelligent.",

"I look forward to the moment, @%s, when you realize that every day for you is a complete waste of time and opportunities.",

"@%s, the most astonishing thing is that you still don't admire yourself, despite your @degenerative skills.",

"I'm simply limiting myself, @%s, so that you don't feel completely alone in your ignorant state.",

"Who would have thought that in our age you, @%s, could be considered a direct descendant of Karl Marx—your ideas are just as useless and @оutdаted.",

"@%s, you are a perfect example of how @stuрidity has no limits.",

"I have a proposal for you, @%s: stop being such a failure and try doing something useful in your life. Although, wait, I'm not even sure you have the intelligence for that.",

"I look at you, @%s, and can't help but wonder how your @parents managed to raise such a useless specimen.",

"I can't help but admire how @%s consistently reaches new levels of @idiocy. Maybe you'll earn some recognition for that, at least?",

"Your inability to learn from your @mistakes, @%s, translates only to your ability to make empty promises. How do you manage to not get lost in your @blunders?",

"You, @%s, prove that @infinity isn't the longest time when you're trying to accomplish the simplest task.",

"It's really interesting, @%s, who taught you such incompetence and hopelessness? Were your @parents responsible, or did you achieve such a high level of stupidity on your own?",

"Every time you say something, @%s, I imagine a whole factory of idiocy working at maximum production capacity to produce your dumb statements.",

"You're such an ignorant person, @%s, that you can't even deceive your own shadow. Maybe it's time to stop and think about why you've contaminated the internet with @уоur @раthetic presence?",

"I see, @%s, that you're an expert in getting into foolish situations. I hope you'll take pride in that throughout your life.",

"Your actions, @%s, are impressively devoid of any ideas. Someday, you'll be able to proudly tell your grandchildren how you wasted your life on pointless endeavors.",

"Kid, @%s, give me one reason why I should waste my brain cells to explain to you how untalented you appear to everyone around you."
